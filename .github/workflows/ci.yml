# 🧩 This is your GitHub Actions workflow file
# Every workflow file must live inside .github/workflows/
# The file extension is always .yml or .yaml (both work the same)

name: Python CI with Pytest # 🏷️ This is just a name for the workflow (shows up in GitHub Actions tab)

on: # ⚙️ This defines WHEN the workflow runs
  push: # 🚀 Runs every time you push new code
    branches: [main] # 🧠 You can change this to any branch (e.g. 'dev')
  pull_request: # 👀 Runs when someone opens or updates a pull request
    branches: [main]

jobs: # 🧱 A workflow is made up of one or more jobs
  build: # 🧰 We'll call this job "build"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # 💻 This tells GitHub what OS to use in the cloud (Ubuntu VM)

    steps: # 📜 A job has multiple 'steps'
      - name: Checkout code # 🪜 Step 1: Get your code into the VM
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 # 🧰 Official GitHub action to clone your repo automatically

      - name: Set up Python # 🧪 Step 2: Install Python on the runner
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5 # 🧰 Official action that installs any Python version
        with:
          python-version: "3.10" # 🧠 Always specify version — consistency matters in CI/CD

      - name: Install dependencies # 📦 Step 3: Install the packages listed in requirements.txt
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
        # 🧠 This command now installs pytest, which we added to our requirements file.

      - name: Run tests with pytest # ✅ Step 4: Run your tests
        run: |
          pytest
        # 🧠 This is the key command. Pytest is smart and will automatically find
        # 🧠 any files named 'test_*.py' and run the test functions inside them.
        # 🧠 If any test fails, this step will fail, and GitHub will show a red 'X'.
