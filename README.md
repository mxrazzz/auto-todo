   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Or create a release on GitHub:**

   - Click "Releases" â†’ "Create a new release"
   - Choose a tag version (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
   - Click "Publish release"

3. **What happens automatically:**

   - The `.zip` is automatically attached to your release
   - Anyone can download the packaged app from the Releases page!
